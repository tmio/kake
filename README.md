# Have some Kake!

Implementation of make, taken after rake, in Kotlin.

Hence the K in Kake. Yep.

# Build
Using Buildr.

## Get buildr
1. `gem install buildr`
2. You're done. I made a bunch of assumptions about your setup and all that. Go to buildr.apache.org and talk to users@buildr.apache.org for help.

## Run the tests

`buildr test`

## Generate intelliJ files

`buildr idea`

# Send me money
OK, nevermind.
